ðŸ‘‹ howdy! I'm zac, I work on [GitHub Repos](https://github.com/github). 

I've previously worked on [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/?nav=min) and [SAS Visual Analytics](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/visual-analytics.html).

I am super interested in devops, industrial strength software, compilers and data visualization!

I'm currently learning piano, ruby, graphql and go.

In my free time I like playing games, cycling, and science fiction.
